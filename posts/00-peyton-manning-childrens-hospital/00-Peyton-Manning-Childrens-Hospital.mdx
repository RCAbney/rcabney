![Peyton Manning Children's Hospital Website](./images/pmch.jpg)

We recently redesigned the Peyton Manning Children's Hospital website in Wordpress. My major contribution to this project was developing a component for our provider team pages. In the past, these pages were hand-coded and had to be manually updated in several places (not just this website) each time a provider's status changed. My solution was to create a component that interfaces with our online provider finder database API and returns the most updated physician biographies for any given team page. This ensures that the latest and most correct data is always displayed, and status updates are now handled in one place, instead of two to five different sites/databases.
